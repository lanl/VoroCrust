# Example 2Cubes_2mat - NON_MANIFOLD


2 Unit cubes with one material interface.
Simple Example for testing file formats and mesh correctness.

These directories include the LaGriT interpolation method to view the voronoi cells from VC
Large files are not included but can be sent via transfer or re-created from files here.
Contact millerta for files.


- VC: 2cube vorocrust results 

- VC_buffered: 2cube with buffer vorocrust results 

- tet_for_fehm: 3D tet mesh used for the surfaces and FEHM model files for the tet mesh

- images: includes vorocrust and interpolated voronoi surfaces
