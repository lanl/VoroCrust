# CHECK topology, should have 0 inconsistent elements
# Note this checks that all are inward or outward in same direction
# Note that internal boundaries will result in 3 elems sharing an edge
# For instance
#  geniee: mesh has 32  jtet loops, max cycle length=  3 
#  means there are  32 edges with more than 2 faces sharing an edge
#  and there is no single solution for checking or fixing this
