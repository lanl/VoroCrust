# LANL Examples


## GDSA Cube Test Examples 1-4 


These Test examples were created for GDSA Integration with JewelSuite for Alluvial Basin. They are used to develop an integrated workflow
between the JewelSuite GFM, Mesh generation, and Verification simulations with FEHM and PFLOTRAN.
All four examples are multi-material and NON_MANIFOLD.
