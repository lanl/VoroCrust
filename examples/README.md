# LANL Examples for Geologic Applications


## 2Cubes_2mat 

Simple NON_MANIFOLD Example for testing file formats and mesh correctness.
2 Unit cubes with one material interface.
Includes directory /tet_for_fehm with FEHM .stor geometric coefficent files and modeling setup files.

## GDSA_Tests 

This directory has Cube_Tests 1-4 examples from the JewelSuite GFM.
SFWST / SFWD-GDSA Geologic Model Integration  includes: 3D Geologic Framework Software, an UZ Reference case for Alluvial Basin (LANL and SNL), and a Shale Reference Case (SNL). The use of VoroCrust is being explored for Voronoi polyhedral meshing to automate and make more efficient part of the model setup workflow as well as increase the accuracy of the flow and transport simulations.

## Slope_Tests 

This is a directory of Slope Examples typically difficult for conforming tet meshing.
Directories include VC with input and output vorocrust files. 


*This directory has the 7 layer examples that vorocrust was unable to mesh:*

## dfn_fractures

These examples are created from dfnWorks and represent 2D fractures within a box.
