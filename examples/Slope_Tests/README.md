# LANL Slope Examples

This is a directory of Slope Examples typically difficult for conforming tet meshing.
Directories include VC with input and output vorocrust files. 

## tet_incline - MANIFOLD

Example taken from tests for CO2 plume using surface from Wyoming Uplift. 
The challenge is a smooth mesh with good geometric coefficients and near 1 Mill nodes.


## uplift_slopes 

These use 8 Wyoming Uplift surfaces to create a 7 material mesh for testing slopes and thickness. 
Each example has 1x (original data), 3x (mult Z by 3), and 6x (mult Z by 6). 
These examples do not include faults.
