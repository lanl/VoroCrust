# Slope examples from Wyoming Uplift Model

These use 8 Wyoming Uplift surfaces to create a 7 material mesh for testing slopes and thickness. 
Each example has 1x (original data), 3x (mult Z by 3), and 6x (mult Z by 6).
These examples do not include the vertical faults in this area.


Vorocrust was able to mesh the shell versions with no internal boundaries (manifold).

* shell_1x
* shell_3x
* shell_6x


Vorocrust was  not able to mesh versions with internal boundaries (non-manifold).

* 7layers_1x
* 7layers_3x
* 7layers_6x
