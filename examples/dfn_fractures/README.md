# dfn_fractures

These fractures were created with dfnWorks software. 
There are two versions of the bounding box, one with fracture in the box and the other with box merged to the edges of the fracture.

*Vorocrust was able to mesh one example, 1_frac_merge_box (fracture touching all sides to the bounding box).*

* 1_frac_merge_box
* 1_frac_hanging
* 4_frac_merge_box
* 4_frac_inbox
